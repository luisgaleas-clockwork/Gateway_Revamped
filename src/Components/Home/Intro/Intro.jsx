            <p>Sydney is a coastal metropolis whose five million residents make it the largest city in Australia and is famolus for many things.
                 The glittering harbour, complemented by landmarks like the Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
                 The dozens of sun-bathed beaches features a spectacular coastline. A sophisticated food and drink scene befitting a city of this stature. But one thing you
                 might not know about Sydney is the origin of this nickname. Sydney is more often called "The Harbour City".</p>
